Clops (Cluj Shops) would be an application which would
register your shop or shops to a shop list from Cluj
which would later be accessible by the public.
The shop would contain the name, the address,
an email and a net income.
There would be user authentication for each company
to register it's shop or shops. 
When we would add a shop we would send an e-mail to
the company email entered.
